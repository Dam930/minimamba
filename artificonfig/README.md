## :inbox_tray: Installation
<details>
<summary>

### Initialization

</summary>

**N.B. This section is intended for the person who creates the project and must be followed only once during project setup**

Execute the following make command to start the initialization procedure:
  ```shell
  make init
  ```

The procedure will ask you to enter the project info (name, author, etc.) and will guide you through the setup of a conda environment and git repository.

The procedure assumes that you have Anaconda installed on the system and a default Python interpreter available.

### Install project and dependencies

</summary>

Create a new Python 3.9 environment:

```shell
conda create --name env_name python=3.9
```

Activate the conda environment just created:

```shell
conda activate env_name
```

Install dependencies on the environment:

```shell
make install
```

or the following command if you want to install dependencies for developing mode:
```shell
make dev
```

## :card_index_dividers: Structure

<details>
<summary>

The project contains:

</summary>
<br/>

:file_folder: `artificonfig` : that contain the code of the project. We encourage to split the project in
different subfolders, one for each project module.

:file_folder: `tests` : in this folder will be stored the python test files for pytest. A sample script is contained.

:file_folder: `utils` : it contains some scripts for support operations, you can add other scripts if needed.

:file_folder: `docs` : it contains the documentation in html folder, the documentation is autogenerated, do not
modify the folder content. (see utils chapter)

:page_facing_up: `.flake8` for the configuration of the formatter.

:hammer: `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the gitlab definition of the CI pipeline.

:hammer: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for the definition of the hooks caught by the pre-commit.

:bookmark: `CHANGELOG.md` is an autogenerated code, contains the history of changelog commits. (see [Utils](#gear-utils) chapter on how to update it)

:card_index: `LICENSE`

:page_facing_up: `Makefile` (see [Utils](#gear-utils) for details)

:page_facing_up: `requirements.txt`/`requirements_dev.txt` for packages required by the project. You can append the packages needed.

:nut_and_bolt: `setup.py` is the project installer, which is the standard for distributing Python Modules if someone wants to
install the project, typically for external use.
